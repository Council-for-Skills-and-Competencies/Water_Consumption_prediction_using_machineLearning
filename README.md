# Forecasting Household Water Consumption with Machine Learning

## Abstract
Water scarcity is a pressing issue worldwide. This project investigates the use of machine learning techniques to forecast household water consumption. By combining socio-economic and environmental variables, the model provides insights that can contribute to sustainable water resource management.

## Objectives
- Develop a predictive model for household water usage,  
- Understand the relationship between influencing factors,  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different machine learning methods.  

## Methodology
1. Data collection and preparation,  
2. Handling missing values and categorical encoding,  
3. Exploratory analysis of consumption patterns,  
4. Model development using regression techniques,  
5. Evaluation using statistical metrics such as RÂ², MAE, and MSE.  

## Tools and Frameworks
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Findings
The results confirm that machine learning can accurately predict water consumption trends. Such predictions can be applied to urban planning and conservation strategies.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate IoT-based smart water meter data,  
- Compare results with deep learning models,  
- Deploy on cloud platforms for real-time usage forecasting.
